 Your data markers:
  - Reflect the magnitude of the earthquake by their size and depth of the earthquake by color
  - Earthquakes with higher magnitudes should appear larger
  - Earthquakes with greater depth should appear darker in color

Hint: The depth of the earth can be found as the third coordinate for each earthquake.

 Popups: 
  - Provide additional information about the earthquake when its associated marker is clicked.

Create a legend
  - Provides context for your map data.
